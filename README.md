CC Safety Net is short for Coding CLI Safety Net. It is a PreToolUse hook that blocks destructive commands and access to secrets such as SSH keys and `.env` files before the tool call runs. It parses what a command does, so flag reordering, shell wrappers, and interpreter one-liners cannot bypass it.

> [!NOTE]
> **[Full documentation →](https://ccsafetynet.com/docs)** covers installation, configuration, reference material, guides, and the security model. This README is the short version.

## Why this exists

We built CC Safety Net after an agent [wiped hours of work](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1pgxckk/claude_cli_deleted_my_entire_home_directory_wiped/) with one `rm -rf ~/` or `git checkout --`. Instructions did not stop it. Rules in `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` can guide an agent, but they cannot enforce a technical limit. CC Safety Net watches relevant tool calls and blocks destructive commands and secret access before they reach the shell. See [What is CC Safety Net](https://ccsafetynet.com/docs/introduction) for the full background.

## Quick start

You need Node.js 18 or higher.

Run the interactive selector to install CC Safety Net into one or more installed coding CLIs:

```bash
npx -y cc-safety-net@latest install
```

To update every installed integration:

```bash
npx -y cc-safety-net@latest update
```

Keep the `@latest` qualifier; a bare `cc-safety-net` spec can run an older cached copy from the npx cache. `npx -y cc-safety-net uninstall` removes integrations interactively, and `npm install -g cc-safety-net` gives you `ccsn`, a shorter alias for the same commands.

## Supported coding CLIs

CC Safety Net supports the coding agent CLIs below on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Automated tests cover the analyzer and some Windows integrations. Other hosts have best-effort Windows support that has not been tested. Amp documents macOS, Linux, and WSL, but not native Windows.

## What it does

| Capability | What it catches |
|---|---|
| **Semantic command analysis** | Detects the intent of `rm -rf` on destructive targets, `git reset --hard`, `git checkout --`, `git push --force`, `git stash clear`, `git clean -f`, unsafe `find -delete`, `dd`, `mkfs`, and `shred`. It allows `git checkout -b feature` but blocks `git checkout -- file`. |
| **Shell wrapper detection** | Finds destructive commands inside `bash -c`, `sh -c`, and similar wrappers. It analyzes nested wrappers up to 10 levels deep. |
| **Interpreter one-liners** | Finds destructive code in `python -c`, `node -e`, `ruby -e`, and `perl -e` one-liners such as `os.system("rm -rf /")`. |
| **Fail-closed by default** | Blocks malformed hook input and, in strict mode, commands it cannot parse. Invalid configuration never blocks. CC Safety Net drops an unverifiable rule source and uses protective defaults when it cannot read `policy.json`. It reports these states in block messages, `doctor`, the status line, and the GUI. |
| **Secret protection** | Blocks content access to SSH keys, `.env` files, `~/.aws`, Kubernetes, Docker, and gcloud configuration, and coding-CLI credential stores. The rules apply to shell commands and read, edit, write, and search tools. |
| **Custom rules via rulebooks** | Lets you add blocking rules at user or project scope. Rulebooks are live JSON files: local ones are authored in place, and rulebooks fetched from GitHub are validated and vendored into your own configuration, updating only when you run `rule update`. |
| **Audit logging** | Writes allowed and blocked command decisions to local per-project JSONL, redacts secrets, and keeps records for 30 days by default. Browse them with `npx cc-safety-net logs`, or review them in the Activity view of `npx cc-safety-net gui`. |

## Official rulebooks for AWS, Terraform, gcloud, and Azure

The [cc-safety-net/rulebooks](https://github.com/cc-safety-net/rulebooks) repository publishes curated rulebooks that block recognizable destructive infrastructure CLI operations: `terraform destroy` and `terraform state rm`, `aws s3 rm` and `aws ec2 terminate-instances`, `gcloud projects delete` and `gcloud storage rm`, `az group delete` and `az keyvault purge`, and more. Safe previews such as `--dryrun` and `-dry-run` stay allowed. Install a selection with one command:

```bash
npx -y cc-safety-net rule add --only terraform aws --global
```

Rulebooks are JSON data: never executed, only adding denials, unable to weaken built-in protections. Installing vendors the files into your own configuration; nothing updates in the background. See [Official Rulebooks](https://ccsafetynet.com/docs/configuration/rulebooks).

## Team setup

Members who install CC Safety Net once per machine are protected in every repository at the standard preset, so the minimum team setup is automating that install in your project's existing bootstrap step, such as an npm `postinstall` script. To standardize more than the defaults, a team lead commits a project policy and project-scoped rulebooks under `.cc-safety-net/`, and every clone picks them up with no member action. Policy changes stay human-approved: `policy apply` requires a terminal confirmation and refuses agent invocations, and any field a project policy relaxes below a member's own policy is reported line by line in `status`, `doctor`, and the GUI. See [Team Setup](https://ccsafetynet.com/docs/guides/team-setup).

## Why not just use a sandbox?

A workspace-writable sandbox still permits `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`, and `rm -rf .` inside the project directory. The operating system sees writes to an allowed path. A sandbox limits where a process can write. CC Safety Net blocks destructive operations inside that allowed area. Use both. See [vs Sandboxing](https://ccsafetynet.com/docs/guides/vs-sandboxing).

## Safety presets

Set a session safety preset with the GUI `npx cc-safety-net gui` then navigate to the policy tab:

| Preset | Effect |
|---|---|
| Standard | Blocks recognizable destructive Git and filesystem commands. Allows metadata-only checks of built-in sensitive paths while continuing to block content access. Recommended for normal coding. |
| Strict | Standard, plus blocks dynamic or unparseable commands the analyzer cannot verify safely and metadata-only discovery of built-in sensitive paths. Occasional false positives on advanced shell. |
| Paranoid | Strict, plus blocks `rm -rf` inside your project and interpreter one-liners. Expect friction; for untrusted agents or high-stakes repos. |

## Diagnostics and tracing

```bash
# Summarize what is being enforced right now
npx cc-safety-net status
# Verify your installation and run a self-test
npx cc-safety-net doctor
# Trace how a command is analyzed step-by-step
npx cc-safety-net explain "git reset --hard"
# Browse recorded denials from the audit trail (add --all to include allowed commands)
npx cc-safety-net logs
# Review what was blocked and edit your policy in a local web GUI
npx cc-safety-net gui
```

`doctor`, `explain`, and `logs` support `--json` for machine-readable output. The audit trail stays on your machine. It records command decisions, but it does not record command output or prompts.

## The /cc-safety-net skill

The plugin ships a skill that turns your coding agent into a CC Safety Net operator. It never triggers on its own; you invoke it by typing `/cc-safety-net` in the agent (Claude Code lists it under its plugin namespace as `cc-safety-net:cc-safety-net`; Pi and OpenCode register it as a built-in `/cc-safety-net` command).

Reach for it when:

- A command was just refused with `BLOCKED by CC Safety Net` and you want the step-by-step reason.
- A block looks wrong and you want it triaged: reproduce the decision, fix the responsible custom rule, or report a built-in false positive.
- You want custom blocking rules written, edited, or migrated for you.
- You want CC Safety Net installed into, updated in, or removed from another agent CLI.
- A rule you added does not fire, or you want to confirm protection is active.

Anything you type after the command becomes the request, e.g. `/cc-safety-net why was my last git command blocked` or `/cc-safety-net block terraform destroy in this project`.

## Library API

Node.js hosts that need an in-process allow or deny decision can call the command-check
function directly instead of installing an agent integration:

```bash
npm install cc-safety-net
```

```ts
import { checkCommand } from 'cc-safety-net/api';

function commandIsAllowed(command: string, cwd: string): boolean {
  try {
    const result = checkCommand({ command, cwd });
    if (result.kind === 'allow') return true;
    console.error(result.reason);
    return false;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('CC Safety Net could not check the command', error);
    return false;
  }
}

if (commandIsAllowed('git status', process.cwd())) {
  // The host can now decide how to run the command.
}
```

Usage rules:

- `cwd` is required and must be an absolute directory path. It anchors relative command
  targets and selects the project policy.
- A `deny` result means the host must not execute the command. **If `checkCommand` throws,
  do not execute the command either.**

## Limitations

CC Safety Net denies a tool call before it runs. It does not enforce filesystem permissions, inspect network egress, or contain a process. Two v2 limits matter. First, the policy and sensitive-path command extractors remain mainly POSIX-oriented. Native PowerShell path expressions such as `Get-Content $HOME\.ssh\id_rsa` can evade static path extraction. Second, policy-file protection is a best-effort exact-path guard. It does not emulate commands. Use operating-system permissions, a sandbox, or equivalent runtime controls when you need complete protection.

Codex has one integration-specific limit. Its unified exec path is the default on macOS and Linux. It sends a hook payload when a command starts a session, but it sends none for `write_stdin`. CC Safety Net can inspect and audit the command that opens the session. It cannot inspect or audit text that the model types into the running session. Codex emits no event for that call, so an adapter change cannot close this gap.

[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) contains the full residual-risk registry. [Known Limitations](https://ccsafetynet.com/docs/guides/known-limitations) explains what those risks mean in practice.

## Upgrading from an older version

Run the `update` command from [Quick start](#quick-start) to upgrade every installed integration to the current release.

If you installed rulebooks from GitHub on version 2.2 or earlier, run `npx -y cc-safety-net rule sync` once per scope (add `--global` for user-scope sources) after upgrading. Rulebooks are now live vendored files instead of lock-and-cache state; the command migrates each cached rulebook into its live location and removes the leftovers. Until then, those GitHub-sourced rules are inactive and `status` and `doctor` report the degraded sources.

> [!WARNING]
> If you defined custom rules in a legacy inline config such as `.safety-net.json` or `~/.cc-safety-net/config.json`, CC Safety Net no longer loads those files at runtime. Their rules enforce nothing. Normal use does not show this failure because the commands now run. Run `npx -y cc-safety-net rule migrate` to convert the rules to the rulebook layout. Then run `npx -y cc-safety-net doctor` and confirm that the runtime is `ready`. See the [migration guide](https://ccsafetynet.com/docs/configuration/custom-rules#migrate-legacy-configuration).
